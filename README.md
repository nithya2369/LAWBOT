# LAWBOT
## PROPOSED SYSTEM
LLM + RAG Retrieval – Combines LLM reasoning with RAG-based retrieval for more accurate and context-aware legal responses.
Agentic Workflow – Uses autonomous agents to refine queries, select retrieval sources, and improve search accuracy dynamically.
Multi-Source Data Retrieval – Fetches legal data from internal document databases, external APIs, and web-based legal sources in real time.
Context-Aware Query Processing – Understands complex legal queries beyond simple keyword matching, ensuring better case law interpretation.
Automated Legal Document Chunking – Breaks large legal texts into meaningful chunks for efficient retrieval and summarization.
Real-Time Adaptability – Dynamically adjusts query processing, retrieval strategies, and document ranking based on query complexity.
Query Route Optimization – Dynamically decides whether to fetch data from embedded legal sources or external web APIs based on query type.
Legal Case Summarization – Uses LLM-powered summarization to condense long legal documents and judgments.
Dynamic Prompt Engineering – Enhances LLM responses with optimized prompts that guide the chatbot toward accurate responses.
User Intent Detection – Identifies whether the user needs case law, legal advice, or regulatory documents and tailors responses accordingly.
